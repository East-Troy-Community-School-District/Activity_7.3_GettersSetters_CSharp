/*
 * Food Class
 * 2/26/2023
 * C#.NET I
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 
 * Part 1
 * In this example, we are going to write the Food class, which
 * will represent a piece of food. Let's start by creating the 
 * Food class in a seperate file but still in the FoodClass namespace.
 * 
 * After creating the Food class, let's add 4 instance variables.
 * The first will be the name of the food, the second will be the calories
 * the food contains per serving, the third will be the food group to
 * which the food belongs (there is an enumaration for the food groups
 * already provided), and the fourth will be the serving size for the food
 * in grams.
 * 
 * Next, we will write a constructor that initializes all the instance
 * variables to passed values. Additionally, We will write getter methods 
 * for each instance variable. We will also write a setter method for
 * calories and serving size. Both of these setters should only change
 * the value of the corresponding instance variable if the value is greater
 * than or equal to 0.
 * 
 * Finally, we will write some code in the main to test our class,
 * 
 * Part 2
 * We will rewrite the class to utilize properites instead of getter
 * and setter methods. Which version of the class do you prefer?
